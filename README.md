# Friendology
Friend Finder app created as a Course Project for CS-522 Social Computing, at IIT Ropar. The application asks questions regarding lifestyle choices and personality, as well as a list of friends, and applies Social Computing Principles of Triadic Clousure and Membership Clousure to recommend friends. In real life a lot of us place more weight on one particular aspect of personality- for example, a person A might feel that his taste in movies should match with his prospective friends. Person B might thing his prospective friend should be a Dog Person, etc. Thus application uses a machine learning like algorithm to learn what 'weight' each user places on the similarity in personality type or lifestyle choices while looking for friends! We do this by analysing the similarity between the user and his friends. In addition, the user gets to choose which friends he likes from the suggestions of the app thus fine tuning the algorithm and providing even better suggestions.
